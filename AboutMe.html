<h2 style="color: black;">School life</h2>
<p style="color: black;">As you may know I am a student that currently goes to James Campbell High School. I am in the 11th grade. I am taking this class to help me get an idea of how to code just incase I want a career in web developement. School has never been one of my favorite things just because of all the homework we recieve.</p>
<h3 style="color: black;">Soccer is my life</h3>
<p style="color: black;">Soccer has been a big part of me every since the beginning. I never really realized that I had a talent in this since we won our first state cup. This made me think to myself if I could actually make it to the big leagues. The next big memory of mines was getting choosen to try out for a national soccer team in Casa Grande, Arizona. This team wouldve been able to travel to Spain to play in an international tournament against the best in the world. Unfortunately I did not make the team but I was able to play against the best players across the U.S.</p>
