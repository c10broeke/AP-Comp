<title>About Me</title>

<h2 style="color: white;">MY life</h2>
<p style="color: white;">As you may know I am a student that currently goes to James Campbell High School. I am in the 11th grade. I am taking this class to help me get an idea of how to code just incase I want a career in web developement. School has never been one of my favorite things just because of all the homework we recieve. Most people like to describe me as someone that is very Athletic, caring, outgoing, and fun person. My favorite thing to do is have a boiz night with all my soccer friends. These nights with them were one of the best memories that i will have of highschool. One of my favorite things to do is travel. My dream destination is to go to greece because i am very fascinated with the greek mythology.</p>
<h3 style="color: white;">Soccer is my life</h3>
<p style="color: white;">Soccer has been a big part of me every since the beginning. I never really realized that I had a talent in this since we won our first state cup. This made me think to myself if I could actually make it to the big leagues. The next big memory of mines was getting choosen to try out for a national soccer team in Casa Grande, Arizona. This team wouldve been able to travel to Spain to play in an international tournament against the best in the world. Unfortunately I did not make the team but I was able to play against the best players across the U.S.</p>
