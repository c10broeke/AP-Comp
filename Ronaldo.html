<h1 style="color:white;">The Best player in the world</h1>
<p style="color:white;">Is there really anything to say about the best player in the world. Ronaldo has been my idol for many many years. He is what kept me going on playing the sport that I love. He has one of the best attitudes when playing soccer, his mentality is always very focused on what he has to do. One of my favorite games that he played in was in the 2018 world cup when he scored that final free-kick to tie spain. During that game he scored a hat-trick or three goals. This shows that hard work will pay off in the end.</p>
